__CSS Zen Garden Redesign Concepts__
****

Overall concept for the redesign is simplicity. The website title/ main header will be at the top left. The concept is based on hierarchy and sectioning. The “road to enlightenment” section will be in the box in the top right, separated from the other boxes to place emphasis on it. The “select a design”, “resources”, and “archives” sections will be in the thinner boxes on the right. The other sections are paragraphs of text so they will be in the larger boxes on the left. The footer is a bit misrepresented in the wireframe. The footer will be however thick it is needed depending on how the content expands it. The footer width will remain the same and span the entire page. The x’s within the wireframe represent images. There will be some kind of graphic/illustration on the top left of the page under the main heading. This image will fade into a gradient like inspiration #150. The image on the bottom right of the page will be a heavier image to take advantage of the negative space in that area. Overall, the page will be easy to navigate with the hierarchy clear. My hope is that the user will be able to read through the page in an intuitive way. (Left to right for western english speakers) They should understand the seperation of importance based on how the paragraphs are placed (top to bottom).
